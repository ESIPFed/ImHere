	Last thing we're doing:
	
		Display user profile
	
  Things left to do:
	Force email entered to be all lower-case
	Test system for functionality in different time zones
	Make this macbook available as web server
	Modify new schedule upload and new attendee upload to be event-aware
	New utility to update event-list file (or just edit the file on the server)?
	Remove 7-day cookie expiration?
	Add a hidden, user-entered date variable that overrides current date, for testing purposes?

	List Currently Running Sessions page:
		Fix time problem which occurs after x pm displaying Currently Running Sessions
		Add List All Attendees function (with maybe a search) to Other Actions
		Add List Recommended Collaborators function (only if Interface flag - Yes)
		Add start & end times to currently running session display (Maybe not enough real estate?)

	List Currently Running Events page:
		Check for password when checking in to an event

	Interface with ResearchBit Recommendation system:
		Post to Recommendation System (only if Interface flag = Yes)...
			When user checks in to or out of an event (in updateCheckIn.php);
			When user clicks "View recommended collaborators at this event";
			When user checks in to or out of a session;
			When user clicks "View recommended collaborators in this session";
			When user clicks on another attendees name to view their profile.
		Perhaps...
			We don't want ResearchBit system to try to keep track of who is where when. 
			Duplication of what ImHere is doing. 
			Could result in discrepancies if a post from ImHere to RB fails.
			Instead, we send list of currently checked-in attendees (event or session) and let RB pick from just those.
